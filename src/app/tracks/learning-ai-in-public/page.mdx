## Why this track

I'm a well seasoned developer. I have 11 years of experience building and shipping web-based
business applications. Today, I find myself a beginner again.

When I started experimenting with machine learning and data science in the late 2010s, I was
already late. I had a lot of fun experimenting with things like scikit-learn and building small
predictive models based on clustering or linear regression. But I hit a hard wall at neural nets and
deep learning.

I'm not truly at ground zero. I've been a heavy ChatGPT user since 3.5 beta and have utilized various LLMs to do
all sorts of cool stuff ranging from augmenting my work and development to writing custom bedtime stories for my kids
involving all their favorite characters. But that's it.

Like many of us, I am stepping into a new and uncertain world where a lot of things are changing really fast and I don't
know what will happen. But I know this much, I have some catching up and studying to do!

## Who this is for

If you are already a proficient practionirer of AI tools and methodologies, you will likely find these posts
to be uninteresting and redundant.

It's easier to describe what sort of questions I want to answer for myself, as these writings could benefit both individuals like myself
as well as leaders who have reports that are individuals like myself who may be struggling with AI adoption and rapid change.

1. How capable is AI? What sorts of things can someone with limited (or non-existent) budget actually accomplish?
2. What does all the jargon mean? More technical lingo has crept into all discourse even in circles not technical, at least in the traditional sense.
3. How do these tools work? How do I constrain them? I keep hearing about tokens and context, what are my new constraints?
4. What sorts of new classes of errors do I need to be aware of? I am now in danger from snakes that have never bitten me before.
5. I am hearing a plethora of claims from opposing extremes, how do I separate the truth from the hype and disparaging?

## How to read it

This is not a traditional multi-part series and does not follow a strict order. Some posts will flow naturally
from concept to practice and be better read sequentially, but no strict order will be required as I will be
trying to write atomically. Because of the nature of the goal, posts will naturally flow from very beginner
to more advanced as I progress.
