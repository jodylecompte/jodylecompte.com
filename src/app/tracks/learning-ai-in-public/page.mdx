## Why this track

I'm not an AI researcher. I'm a software engineer who has spent years building web applications and infrastructure, and I came to machine learning late. This track documents that journey honestly — what clicked, what didn't, and what I wish someone had told me earlier.

The posts here aren't tutorials from an expert. They're field notes from someone actively learning, which means they'll sometimes be wrong, sometimes be incomplete, and hopefully always be honest.

## Who this is for

If you're a developer with a solid programming foundation who wants to understand AI beyond the marketing buzzwords, this track is for you. I assume you can write code and reason about systems. I don't assume any prior ML knowledge.

## How to read it

The posts are ordered roughly by when I wrote them, which maps loosely to a progression from concepts to practice. Read them in order if you're starting fresh, or jump around if a specific topic calls to you.
