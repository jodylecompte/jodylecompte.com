## Introduction

Coming from a React background, template-driven forms never really clicked for me. I was used to defining a schema, wiring up a 
few props, and hitting the ground running. That said, I’ll admit — there are a few things that template-driven forms make 
surprisingly easy. Conditional validation logic is one of those things.

```html
<form #form="ngForm">
  <input
    name="email"
    ngModel
    [required]="shouldRequireEmail"
    #email="ngModel"
  />
  <div *ngIf="email.invalid && email.touched">Email is required</div>
</form>
```


These scenarios come up pretty often, and it's a little less clear how to handle the same problem. The most common case is a 
dependent field that only becomes required if another input value is given or contains a specific value. Let's look at a 
few ways we can address this and weigh the trade-offs.

## Preface: You might not need conditional validation

Before proceeding any further, it's worth noting that the default Angular behavior is often sufficient without any custom conditional rules.

For example, suppose you have an optional input for a promo code. The promo code isn't required, but any valid input should 
be at least 6 characters long. This is actually the exact behavior of the `Validators.minLength` validator from `@angular/forms` 
— it only enforces the minimum length if there's actual input in the form field.

To double check, the best reference is the [Angula Official Validators API reference](https://angular.dev/api/forms/Validators).

## The template

For brevity, all examples will show the applicable code only, and will all utilize the same template shown below.

```html
<form [formGroup]="exampleForm">
  <label>
    Where did you hear about us?
    <select formControlName="whereSource">
      <option value="">-- Select one --</option>
      <option value="Facebook">Facebook</option>
      <option value="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</option>
      <option value="Instagram">Instagram</option>
      <option value="Google">Google</option>
      <option value="Other">Other</option>
    </select>
  </label>

  <div *ngIf="exampleForm.get('whereSource')?.value === 'Other'">
    <label>
      Please specify:
      <input type="text" formControlName="whereOther" />
    </label>
    <div
      *ngIf="exampleForm.get('whereOther')?.invalid && exampleForm.get('whereOther')?.touched"
    >
      This field is required.
    </div>
  </div>

  <pre>{{ exampleForm.value | json }}</pre>
  <pre>Valid: {{ exampleForm.valid }}</pre>
</form>
```

## Option 1. Imperative Change Watching

The most straightforward approach is to subscribe to value changes on a single form control, then use the `setValidators` 
method exposed by the `AbstractControl` interface to dynamically add or remove validators. This function accepts the same array
 of validator methods you would use during form group initialization.

```typescript
export class ExampleComponent {
  private fb = inject(FormBuilder);

  exampleForm: FormGroup = this.fb.group({
    whereSource: [""],
    whereOther: [""],
  });

  constructor() {
    this.exampleForm.get("whereSource")?.valueChanges.subscribe((value) => {
      const otherControl = this.exampleForm.get("whereOther");

      if (value === "Other") {
        otherControl?.setValidators([Validators.required]);
      } else {
        otherControl?.clearValidators();
      }

      otherControl?.updateValueAndValidity();
    });
  }
}
```

Take note of the call to `updateValueAndValidity` — Angular does not run another validation cycle automatically when validators are 
changed, so this triggers a re-calculation of the input’s valid/invalid status.

### ✅ **Pros**:

- Simple and explicitly clear
- Easy to expand with other relevant operatons that may not be form specific
- No setup or architectural changes to existing Angular forms

### ❌ **Cons**:

- Imperative logic spread across componnets
- Diffcult to test and even more so to reuse 
- Does not scale well for more complex forms with multiple dependent inputs

## Sidebar About Form Validators
The next two options leverage reactive form validators, so first I want to point out a few changes here.  When swtching to a custom 
validator for our mental model, our first thought may be to do something like this: 

```typescript
function requireOtherIfSourceIsOther(group: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null {
  const source = group.get("whereSource");
  const other = group.get("whereOther");

  if (source?.value === "Other" && !other?.value) {
    other?.setErrors({ required: true });
  } else {
    other?.setErrors(null);
  }

  return null;
}
```

While this is arguably an improvement over manually subscribing to `valueChanges` and toggling validators (Option 1), 
it introduces a subtle but important issue: we've slipped back into imperative logic.

At its core, an Angular validator is simply a function that returns either a `ValidationErrors: Record<string, any>` object or `null` 
if the control is valid. In this example, rather than returning an error, the validator manually sets or clears errors on the control.

The consequence is that controls using this validator may appear valid (because it returns `null`), even though they still 
have errors manually assigned to them. Depending on how your template is written, this can lead to confusing or inconsistent UI 
behavior. The goal should be pure validators that don't directly mutate form state.

## Option 2. Input-Level Custom Validator

This approach uses a custom validator attached directly to the `whereOther` control. Instead of imperatively adding or 
removing validators (Option 1), the logic is pushed into a reusable function that checks if "Other" is selected and applies `Validators.required` 
when necessary.

```typescript
export function otherRequiredIfSourceIsOther(control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null {
  const parent = control.parent;
  if (!parent) return null;

  const source = parent.get("whereSource")?.value;
  const other = control.value;

  if (source === "Other" && !other) {
    return { required: true };
  }

  return null;
}
```

The reference to `control.parent` will always be `null` on the first run. By returning `null`, Angular will start with the component in a valid 
state. This should be invisible most of the time, but it's something to be aware of.

Applying this validator is the same as using any built-in validator.

```typescript
export class ExampleComponent {
  private fb = inject(FormBuilder);

  exampleForm: FormGroup = this.fb.group({
    whereSource: [""],
    whereOther: ["", otherRequiredIfSourceIsOther],
  });

  constructor() {
    this.exampleForm.get("whereSource")?.valueChanges.subscribe(() => {
      this.exampleForm.get("whereOther")?.updateValueAndValidity();
    });
  }
}
```

Let's hone in on the `updateValueAndValidity` call, because this is where your error-handling strategy really matters. 
Angular doesn't actually know that these fields are co-related, so it won't re-run the validator on the `whereOther` 
control when `whereSource` changes.

If your strategy is real-time feedback, you'll want to use some version of the above pattern to ensure the dependent 
field gets re-validated when its sibling changes. If you're doing submit-based error handling, you can usually skip 
the subscription and just call `updateValueAndValidity` right before checking the form's validity inside your submit 
handler. Alternatively, for multiple fields, you could subscribe to the `valueChanges` observable of the entire 
form object.


### ✅ **Pros**:

- Completely declrative approach
- Easier to target with automated testing
- No manual form state management

### ❌ **Cons**:
- Tightly coupled to specific components
- Mixed concerns, validator knows about components other than the one it is validating
- Repeated logic if multiple dynamic fields

## Option 3. Form Level Custom Validator

Shifting the validation up to the form level only needs minimal changes, and now we recieve a reference to the entire
form group to load values or form state as needed. 

```typescript
export function requireOtherIfSourceIsOther(group: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null {
  const source = group.get("whereSource")?.value;
  const other = group.get("whereOther")?.value;

    if (source === "Other" && !other) {
    return { otherRequiredIfSourceIsOther: true };
  }

  return null;
}
```

### ✅ **Pros**:

- 100% Declarative and hands off (even validity status)
- No repeated logic across multiple controls
- Better separaton of concerns

### ❌ **Cons**:
- Still tightly coupled
- Two locations for both validators and error objects can be confusing
- Non-standard error names can lead to inconsistent naming over time

## Bonus - Fix the Coupling

Normally I'd caution against premature abstraction, but the lift is so light between a one-off 
validator and a parameterized version that it's worth doing upfront in most cases.

For example:

```typescript
export function requiredIfSiblingEquals(
  siblingControlName: string,
  expectedValue: any
): ValidatorFn {
  return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
    const parent = control.parent;
    if (!parent) return null;

    const sibling = parent.get(siblingControlName);
    if (!sibling) return null;

    const siblingValue = sibling.value;
    const thisValue = control.value;

    return siblingValue === expectedValue && !thisValue
      ? { required: true }
      : null;
  };
}
```

Usage just means plugging in your keys and condition:

```typescript  
exampleForm: FormGroup = this.fb.group({
  whereSource: [""],
  whereOther: ["", requiredIfSiblingEquals("whereSource", "Other")],
});
```

## Conclusion

What starts as a simple "this field is required if..." quickly becomes a conversation about 
maintainability and user expeience. The techniques shown here give you options, but they also ask for 
intentionality. Choose a method not just because it works — but because it fits the shape of your 
app, your team, and your long-term needs.
